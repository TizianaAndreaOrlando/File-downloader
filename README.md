## Requirements

Python version 3.9.6

## Description

The program lets us automate the downloading process. 
While downloading a file, the machine tends to download it in a specific directory (downloads).
We want to do the same process but with a directory of our choice and download it in a specific one depending on its final extension. 
For example, if we want to download a file with the extension .jpg, we will save it into one called "images".
If we would like to download a file with the extention.txt, .pdf, or .doc we will do it in a directory 
called "Documents" and so on. 

## Purpose of the project

The main aim was to automate this process of downloading, which is a task I am doing on a daily and this
tend to took me a while after I have finished downloading all my files for then organize them in their 
propper directories, so if I could do it just one time and save time,  I consider the project was worth it and a time saver.
